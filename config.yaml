    content: |-
      I would like to introduce myself as a Junior Front-end software development enthusiast with a passion for creating innovative digital experiences. I have a degree in Computer Science and bring with me a professional trajectory marked by valuable experiences and a solid commitment to quality and innovation.

      I started my professional journey in a project called “Training and Production of Teaching Material for Programming Competition Marathons”. This opportunity allowed me to build and apply materials that prepared teams for national and international programming competitions, highlighting my commitment to quality and education in the area.

      Later, I entered the world of website, software and application development, focusing on Front-end. As a web software development intern, I worked with software such as Open Journal System, Open Preprint System and Open Monograph Press. During this period, I focused on creating visual identities and themes for academic portals, in addition to developing personalized functionalities to meet the specific needs of each client.

      I highlight my competence in JavaScript and TypeScript languages, combined with frameworks such as React and Next.js. I developed and implemented widely used projects of my own, focusing on the extensive implementation of unit and integration tests, following agile methodologies and testing methodologies. Furthermore, all of my projects follow the digital accessibility guidelines defined by W3C, ensuring inclusive and accessible experiences for all users.

        content: 'I interned at Lepidus Tecnologia, working on the “Journals in the Cloud” project, creating portals and journals for Brazilian and Angolan institutions. Using open-source tools like OJS, OPS, and OMP, I crafted their visual identities, collaborating closely with clients to meet design preferences. Employing Figma for prototyping and Vue, CSS, HTML, and Smarty Template, I built themes, ensuring strict adherence to software documentation and conducting end-to-end tests with Cypress. I also implemented new functionalities, like a filtering plugin, following Test-Driven Development using PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (jQuery), Vue, HTML, CSS, PHPUnity, and Cypress. Resolving text display issues in journals, I applied a CSS fix using “font-display: swap” for seamless user experience. Additionally, I spearheaded the creation of Lepidus Tecnologias’ new corporate website, revamping its visual identity and technologies with Hugo, gaining WordPress expertise for site maintenance and contributing to internal functionalities like continuous integration (CI/CD) processes through YML in a Docker environment.'
